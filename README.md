# Pog repository for non-portable packages

This is a non-default package repository for the [Pog package manager](https://github.com/MatejKafka/Pog), containing non-portable packages that attempt to store data in `AppData` and other non-encapsulated folders. The goal of this repository is to make installing and updating these packages easier, even if some Pog features are not supported.
